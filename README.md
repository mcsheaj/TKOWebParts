# tkoWebPart
Image slider web part for SharePoint on premises or online using Typescript and KnockoutJs.

Code for "Customizing SharePoint with Knockout and TypeScript" at #SPSHOU

Steps to setup:

- Setup NodeJs, npm and Visual Studio Code as per [Set up your SharePoint client-side web part development environment](https://dev.office.com/sharepoint/docs/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment).  Note: you can skip Yeoman and Gulp.  You can technically use any editor in place of VSCode.
- Install webpack globally: **npm install webpack@2.2.1 -g**
- Install typescript globally: **npm install typescript@2.1.5 -g**
- Install git: https://git-scm.com/
- Clone the project on the command line:
    - change directory to where you want the project
    - **git clone https://github.com/mcsheaj/tkoWebPart.git**
- Change directory to tkoWebPart
- **npm install**
- **npm run buildI**

I'll write this up a bit better time-permitting
